# 🚀 Frontend Learning Projects

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little web playground where I tinker, build, break, and learn everything frontend. This repo is a collection of all the mini-projects and experiments I've done while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ✨ What’s Inside?

Here’s a quick peek at some of the projects you’ll find in here:

1. [**Single-Page CV**](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv) – Layout with HTML and little bit CSS. Raw, clean, and semantic.
2. [**Basic HTML Website**](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website) - HTML only website with multiple pages
3. [**Personal Portfolio**](https://roadmap.sh/projects/portfolio-website) - Simple HTML and CSS responsive website
4. [**Change Log**](https://roadmap.sh/projects/changelog-component)

## 🧠 Why I Made This?

I'm learning frontend development, one project at a time. Instead of watching 100 tutorials back-to-back, I believe in **learning by building**. Every project here helped me understand a new concept or tool — from semantic HTML to JavaScript DOM manipulation.
